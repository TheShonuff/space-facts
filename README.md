## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

### What I learned

This was a great excerise to learn Svelte. I've been experimenting with some different frameworks latelt and Svelte was really enjoyable to learn. I didn't really have any issues when creating the solution to this challenge. The main hurdle was getting the planets to display different sizes based on the viewing device. I had to use reactivity and set the style tag appropriately. Working with Stores was a breath of fresh air compared to how React handles state.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue to develope with Svelte in the future. There was recently a major update and I'll need to familiarize myself with some of the latest changes. I've been very happy with Svelte and will use this as my go to framework of choice.
